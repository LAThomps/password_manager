# password_manager
An app to securely manage your passwords, written in python for Windows.<br>

You will need python installed on your computer to use this app, and I've only built it<br>
for use on the `Windows OS at this time (if anyone would like a macOS/Linux version just<br>
let me know)

To download/install this app, simply clone the `for_public` branch of this repo and<br>
run the `install.bat` file located in `bat_scripts` from the `bat_scripts` directory.
